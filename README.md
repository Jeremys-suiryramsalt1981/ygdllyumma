Okay, still reeling. Just saw It Feeds and I feel like my brain's been chewed up and spit out like day-old gum, you know? Like, what did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? I'm sitting here on this hard bench and my back is screaming, but all I can think of is that scene with the... with the weirdly cute but creepy thing under the bed or whatever that just won't. stop. staring. like it's trying to eat your thoughts.

Popcorn everywhere, I think one popcorn went down my back, ugh, gotta deal with that. But the visuals in this  , seriously, they're like if a kaleidoscope and a nightmare had a messy, beautiful baby. You know, colorful but dark at the same time. There's this one part where everything went colorburst crazy and my brain kinda 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘬ed out through my ears. Oh yeah, and the sound was, like, lava loud. If that makes sense? Like it vibrated through my bones the way a cat purr can.

> And speaking of cats, there's this random scene with a cat that just sits in the middle of chaos, licking itself. Unbothered, like the universe around it isn’t imploding. Made me think about Schrodinger's Cat, only instead of questions of existence it’s questions about sanity. Did someone ask me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Or was it to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? Anyway, resist the urge to leave your brain unharmed, 'cause this one doesn’t hold back!

The theater was too damn noisy, people whisper-shouting theories and a phone went off at the quietest part — almost more distracting than realizing that I’ve been sitting on popcorn crumbs for two hours. Anyway, the way they juxtaposed fear with hunger, primal and gnawing, reminds me of those days you fast unintentionally and everything’s just... off.

Every twist and turn, like a pretzel made of plot. You chew on it, it's salty, it makes you thirsty for explanations but the drink never arrives, ya know? Like, just some answers, please!

Oh, the  's frazzled my brain enough that I started seeing shadow things in the theater after. You ever 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 so intense you feel like the characters and monsters will step out of the screen? Yeah, that.

So, tell me your thoughts if you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  … or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , sleep optional. My thoughts are scattered like the wreckage of an exploded star. They're everywhere and nowhere. Like this:

```
if (brain.HorrorExperience) {
    thoughts.𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘬Out();
    reality.Wobble();
}
```
